  U.S. stocks closed slightly higher Wednesday as the financial sector helped to cap a sharp drop in energy shares, ahead of potentially market moving events on Thursday, including the U.K. election and former FBI director James Comey Senate testimony.

  Investors are focused on the so-called “Super Thursday” trio events: testimony on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election from former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey, the U.K. general election and a European Central Bank meeting. Stocks, which had been trading in negative territory on the session, returned to gains for the day following the
  release of Comey’s prepared testimony
  before the Senate.
 </p>
 <p>
  Preceding Comey’s testimony, Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats and Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe
  on Wednesday refused to answer senators
  on whether President Donald Trump had asked them to intervene in a probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
 </p>
 <p>
  “What we have tomorrow and next week is what is driving everything right now,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. “Combine that with the Fed meeting next week and that’s a lot of uncertainty for the market.” The Federal Reserve is slated to hold its two-day policy meeting next week, with an updated policy statement to be released June 14.
 </p>
 <p>
  But the market is showing resilience, especially with the big drop in oil prices, he said. “The market’s been able to hold off on a big selloff despite all of that,” Kepner said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Adding to the mix, stocks pulled back from modest gains Wednesday around the same time that S&amp;P Global Ratings
  downgraded its sovereign rating of Qatar’s debt
  and unsubstantiated reports of another North Korea missile launch, only to recover later.
 </p>
 <p>
  “No one wants to make big moves ahead of these events. And since we don’t even have much economic data to trade off of, trading should be pretty quiet. We’ll just be floating around,” said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management.
 </p>
 <p>
  Schutte said although Thursday’s events could lead to elevated volatility in the short-term, they were unlikely to markedly change the tone on Wall Street. “It doesn’t appear that a huge amount of new information will come out, so while these factors could move us in the short term, they won’t matter over longer-time horizons,” he said.
 </p>
 <p>
  Geopolitics and economy:
  Consumer credit for April slowed it is
  smallest increase in almost six years
  for an annual growth rate of 2.6%.
 </p>
 <p>
  One focus is the run-up to the U.K. general election. While voters head to the polls Thursday, the outcome will likely not be known until Friday morning London time.
 </p>
 <p>
  Opinion polls mostly indicate a victory for Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative Party, but there are signs it could be a neck-and-neck race with the opposition Labour Party. An unexpected result could trigger volatility across Europe, spilling over to U.S. markets.
