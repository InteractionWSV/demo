              Analysis of Eye Movement Data
            </h2>

            <p>We conducted a study to evaluate how participants use the visual analytics system VarifocalReader to find benefits and weaknesses for further development. The objective of our study was to get insights about how participants navigate with the hierarchical visualization. We investigated how participants use visual abstractions as well as how helpful they are at the various layers and for different analysis tasks.<p>

            <p>We conducted the study with 16 participants (twelve female, four male). The average age of participants was 23.5 years (min = 21, max = 33). Eleven of the participants were students from the humanities and five studied computational linguistics. We only analyze the eye movement data of 8 participants due to technical problems and the study design. The task participants had was to use VarifocalReader to explore the book by Emil Staiger "Grundbegriffe der Poetik" ("Basic Terms of Poetics") and answer the questions if Schiller's work "Wallenstein" is a typical example of dramatic poetry and which other works are referenced in this context?</p>

            <p>We mainly focus our analysis on the attention maps of participants eye movement data. For participants <span class="entity participant" data-wsv-type="attention map">P01</span> and <span class="entity participant" data-wsv-type="attention map">P10</span> we find that they have focused on each part of the stimulus during the study. In contrast, <span class="entity participant" data-wsv-type="attention map">P14</span> or <span class="entity participant" data-wsv-type="attention map">P07</span> did not focus on the middle part, which is most likely the area where the paragraph layer is, indicating that they did not need this part to answer the question.</p>

            <p> The most attention for participants <span class="entity participant" data-wsv-type="attention map">P09</span>, <span class="entity participant" data-wsv-type="attention map">P13</span>, and <span class="entity participant" data-wsv-type="attention map">P15</span> are on the right, which is the area were the actual text document is shown in the VarifocalReader.
            </p>

            <p> Inspecting <span class="entity participant" data-wsv-type="attention map">P05</span> we find that there is no area that got a lot of attention and there is just a small part in the bottom middle that was not focused on at all.
